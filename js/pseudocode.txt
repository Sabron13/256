TO DO:

spawn 2s and 4s after each movement
what happens if you don't input a string?


Pseudocode:

Storage:
Nested array of Square objects.

How do blocks spawn?
For the first 4 moves, a 2 randomly spawns in an empty space.
After that, a 2 or a 4 randomly spawns in an empty space.

When does the game disallow a movement?
No empty spaces in the direction of any occupied squares AND
no squares that can combine in that direction.

How do blocks merge?
2 blocks have the same number property AND are next to each other in the direction of movement.
First check the squares at the destination of the direction of motion.
When 2 blocks merge, move the other blocks in the direction accordingly.

How do blocks slide?
Move as far as possible in the direction, before hitting a boundary or another square.

How does the nested array correspond to the view?

[[2, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0]
]

Methods to move left and right require some kind of array rotation.
  Write a method like Ruby's rotate?
Methods to move up and down require some kind of transposition of inner arrays, then rotating that.
